### REF-002: Admin Reference Validation ✅
Status: COMPLETED
- Extended lib/references/actions.ts with validation functions:
  - `validateReference()`: Sets isValidated=true, validatedByUserId, validatedAt
  - `getReferenceById()`: Fetches single reference for detail view
- Created /admin/references page (admin-only route):
  - Lists all pending references (validatedBy = null)
  - Shows summary details (project, customer, dates, tech stack)
  - Links to detail view
- Created /admin/references/[id] detail page:
  - Displays all reference details (project, technical, business, highlights)
  - Shows current validation status
  - Fixed Next.js 15+ params Promise issue
- Created ReferenceValidationButton component:
  - Client-side button with loading state
  - Calls validateReference server action
  - Shows success toast and refreshes page
- Successfully tested: Admin login → View pending → Click reference → Validate
- Verified DB state after validation:
  - is_validated = 1 (true)
  - validated_by_user_id = admin user ID
  - validated_at timestamp set correctly
- Test reference "E-Commerce Plattform Modernisierung" validated by Admin Test
