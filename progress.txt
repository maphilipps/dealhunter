**Issue:** DEA-17 - Database Schema & Drizzle ORM Setup
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Priority:** 1 (Urgent) - Blocked 15 other issues

**Implemented:**
- Added missing tables: `team_assignments` and `subjective_assessments`
- Defined comprehensive Drizzle Relations for all 15 tables
- Added vec0 vector search documentation to README
- Verified all database commands work (db:push, db:seed)

**Tables Added:**
- `team_assignments` - Track team member assignments to RFPs with roles
- `subjective_assessments` - BD subjective ratings (5 metrics on 1-5 scale)

**Relations Defined:**
- Core entities: users, rfps, businessUnits, technologies, employees, accounts
- Scan entities: quickScans, deepMigrationAnalyses
- Master data: references, competencies, competitors
- Support tables: teamAssignments, subjectiveAssessments, documents

**Documentation:**
- Added Database Schema section to README
- Documented vec0 vector search strategy (text-embedding-3-large, 3072 dims)
- Noted vec0 extension is planned for future implementation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
✅ All schemas in lib/db/schema.ts
✅ Drizzle Relations defined for all tables
✅ Performance indexes already comprehensive
✅ vec0 Extension documented
✅ Seed Data works (Business Lines & Technologies)
✅ db:push and db:seed Commands verified

## 2026-01-20 - DEA-2: Extraction Agent implementieren

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**What was implemented:**
- Migrated extraction agent from raw OpenAI SDK to Vercel AI SDK's `generateObject`
- Type-safe structured output with automatic Zod schema validation
- Removed 200 lines of manual JSON parsing and null handling code
- Maintained existing streaming support for real-time UI updates
- Uses claude-haiku-4.5 via adesso AI Hub (OpenAI-compatible endpoint)
- Consistent with other agents in codebase (baseline-comparison, project-planning)

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner, more maintainable code
- Better type safety and error handling
- Automatic Zod validation
- No more manual JSON cleaning

**Files Changed:**
- `lib/extraction/agent.ts` - Core extraction agent migration

**Not Implemented (Future Enhancements):**
- Multi-Pass Extraction (not critical for MVP)
- Per-field confidence scores (has overall confidence)
- DSGVO-Bereinigung (complex, better as separate issue)
