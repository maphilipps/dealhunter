  - Technical details (technologies JSON, scope, team size, duration)
  - Business details (budget range, outcome)
  - Highlights (JSON array)
  - Validation tracking (isValidated, validatedByUserId, validatedAt)
- Created createReference server action with validation:
  - All required fields validated

  - Multi-section form (Project, Technologies, Scope, Budget, Highlights)
  - Tag-based technology input with add/remove
  - Tag-based highlights with add/remove
